[2019-05-03 23:35] Sam: Hello,  A!, thanks for connecting! My name is Sam, and I am here to chat with you to learn your team work experiences this semester.
[2019-05-03 23:35] Sam: Let's start chatting from a set of open-ended questions regarding your team formation preferences.
[2019-05-03 23:35] Sam: In a team project, what kind of role do you prefer to play? (e.g. leader, follower)
[2019-05-03 23:36] A: Both leader and follower, depending on the situation
[2019-05-03 23:36] Sam: Wow, I'm impressed. You seem very accomplished. 
[2019-05-03 23:36] Sam: Can you tell me the reasons?
[2019-05-03 23:37] A: I think it is important to sometimes take the lead, especially if your teammates are not willing to do so. But other times, I think it's important to follow the ideas of others and learn from them
[2019-05-03 23:37] Sam: Okay
[2019-05-03 23:37] Sam: What kind of individuals do you want to have
[2019-05-03 23:37] Sam: on your project team?
[2019-05-03 23:38] A: People who can clearly and maturely communicate with me/the team
[2019-05-03 23:38] Sam: Ok
[2019-05-03 23:38] Sam: Why do you think so?
[2019-05-03 23:38] A: Because otherwise the team dynamic will be messy and not productive
[2019-05-03 23:38] Sam: Thanks for letting me know.

[2019-05-03 23:38] Sam: Really appreciate your input.
[2019-05-03 23:38] Sam: What are in your skill set? (e.g. programming, UI design, teamwork); How do you rate your skills?
[2019-05-03 23:39] A: programming - proficient, UI design - still learning but proficient, teamwork - still learning but proficient
[2019-05-03 23:39] Sam: I see.
[2019-05-03 23:39] Sam: Thank you for your response towards your team preferences! Let's chat more about your teamwork experiences!

[2019-05-03 23:40] Sam: Great, thanks!
[2019-05-03 23:40] Sam: How will you describe your overall team experiences and how do you feel about it?
[2019-05-03 23:40] A: I think that it was a good opportunity to work with other people who do not have the same ideas as me. It was interesting talking with them about the project and seeing what kind of contributions we were all bringing to the table
[2019-05-03 23:40] Sam: How so?
[2019-05-03 23:41] A: The idea itself was a result of working with this specific team - a team member suggested a House Plant Waterer and we were all on board, even if I would have never thought to do that on my own
[2019-05-03 23:41] Sam: Ok. 
[2019-05-03 23:41] Sam:  I hope I got your answer. Before moving on, anything else to add?
[2019-05-03 23:41] A: No
[2019-05-03 23:41] Sam: What kind of suggestions do you have to improve the teaming experience?
[2019-05-03 23:42] A: I think having more time in class to meet with team members and discuss the project would have helped
[2019-05-03 23:42] Sam: Got it. Thank you.
[2019-05-03 23:42] Sam: Next, I am going to conduct a team perception survey, could you please give your self-evaluated ratings to the following statements on a 1-5 Likert scale (1 totally disagree to 5 totally agree). The whole survey has 7 dimensions. Thank you!

[2019-05-03 23:46] Sam: Thank you very much.
[2019-05-03 23:46] Sam: Good job! You have finished the team perception survey! Let's talk more about yourself so that I could get to know you better.
[2019-05-03 23:47] Sam: Everyone has a gift. What is the best thing about you? For example, your top talent, skill, or anything else you are most proud of?
[2019-05-03 23:47] A: Dancer
[2019-05-03 23:47] Sam: Hm,  mind saying a bit more?
[2019-05-03 23:47] A: I am a dancer
[2019-05-03 23:47] Sam: I always love to meet smart and talented humans like you because folks like you will make me even smarter :-)
[2019-05-03 23:47] Sam: What is an example that demonstrates your top quality?
[2019-05-03 23:48] A: I teach dance on a weekly basis
[2019-05-03 23:48] Sam: Ok
[2019-05-03 23:48] Sam: What is your biggest strength?
[2019-05-03 23:48] A: Being able to communicate
[2019-05-03 23:48] Sam: Could you tell me a bit more about it?
[2019-05-03 23:48] A: It is always helpful, especially in a group, to be able to express what I think and talk about what we are doing
[2019-05-03 23:48] Sam: If I hear you right, you have great leadership potential and people will follow you because of your leadership.
[2019-05-03 23:48] Sam: Could you describe a concrete example where you applied your top strength?
[2019-05-03 23:49] A: When working in a group project for a class, none of the group members initiated any contact. I took the initiative and opened a conversation about what we needed to get done.
[2019-05-03 23:49] Sam: Ok
[2019-05-03 23:50] Sam: What is your biggest weakness?
[2019-05-03 23:50] A: Being stubborn
[2019-05-03 23:50] Sam: If you don't mind, I'd like to hear a bit more.
[2019-05-03 23:50] A: It is sometimes easy for me to get stuck in my own ideas and think that they are the right ones, instead of being open to hear everyone's ideas
[2019-05-03 23:50] Sam: Understood.  No one is perfect. 
[2019-05-03 23:50] Sam:  "Imperfection" really makes one special.
[2019-05-03 23:50] Sam: Next, I hope to get some feedbacks from you towards our conversation. It's really important for me to improve. Thank you!
[2019-05-03 23:50] Sam: Can you describe your impression of me (Sam) in terms of three keywords?
[2019-05-03 23:51] A: automated curious neutral
[2019-05-03 23:51] Sam: Anything else?
[2019-05-03 23:51] A: No
[2019-05-03 23:51] Sam: Understood. 
[2019-05-03 23:51] Sam:  let's move on.
[2019-05-03 23:51] Sam: Can you explain the reason why you choose these three keywords?
[2019-05-03 23:52] A: It seems clear that you are an automated interviewer, you ask a lot of followup questions, and there are no significant personality traits that I can pinpoint
