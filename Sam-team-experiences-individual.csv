I would say my programming skills tend to be 3-4/5 in what I currently work in, but I'm sure I have a lot to learn, and the difference between a 4/5 and a 5/5 is massive. UI design, I would put around 1-2/5. I can choose coloration and style attributes pretty well, but my ability to actually design the UI elements and how they work together is lacking.

I took a gap year because high school was very intense and stressful for me, then decided that I wanted to get into CU Boulder. I could not actually become a student until I had college credits, so I took late night classes through Continuing Education. I open enrolled in classes that were at unpopular times. I worked hard for a whole year with minimal help from staff because most people don't know how to help someone in my situation.

The typing bubble was clearly just there to show that something else would be happening as seemed unrealted to the length of the message. Unclear: When asking the team experience questions, I wasn't sure if it was asking specifically about my HCI team or about all teams I've been a part of, which would certainly change some of my answers. I went with the answers I would give if only talking about my HCi team. Scales: During the section where I had to pick on a scale 1 - 5 or Strongly Disagree - Strongly Agree, I felt like I wanted to answer in a certain way with some explanation. For example, it was asking about differences of opinion among the team, which there were sometimes, but we were also able to debate and come to a consensus quickly and respectfully, without destroying any of the team's bonds. It would be nice to have some way to add explanations, potentially at the end of each block of 3-5 questions.",3,3,4,like a counselor,3,2,Chat with me,"The grammar was occasionally offputting or felt unnatural, which definitely reminded me that I was talking to a bot. The responses to multiple choice questions (scales) were instant, which felt a bit strange. Again, more ways to add clarifications to multiple choice (scale) questions if I want to. Some of the responses that were supposed to be more natural instead felt even less natural because the response certainly wasn't customized. For example, in the beginning. It asks about which role you prefer, then responds with ""I'm impressed! You must be very busy."" This has nothing to do with my response to the previous question, nor does it seems appropriate for an answer to the question to reply that way.","Whenever an unfortunate or bad event occurs, my first reaction is always to think through a solution, not to get angry or freeze. For example, I forgot to attempt an assignment for another class this week. Because of this, I could not view the questions on the assignment to review for the final. Instead of being upset, my first reaction was to find a solution. I talked to one of the TA's after a review session, and they allowed me to see the questions."
